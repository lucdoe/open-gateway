# Open Gateway Global Readme

Welcome to the open-gateway project. This project is a collection of tools and services that can be used to create a gateway for small to mid-sized projects.
The project is designed to be modular and flexible, allowing you to use the parts that you need and replace the parts that you don't.

## Structure

The project contains two main folders:

- `gateway`: This folder contains the logic related to the API Gateway.
- `generator`: This folder contains the generator CLI tool for you to tailor the Gateway to your needs.
